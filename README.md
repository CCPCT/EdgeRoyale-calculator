# #EDGEROYALE CALCULATOR
Calculate what spell is needed to bring tower to lowest health possible (while still alive) 🚀👸  
I use this calculator with my friends to "edge"/ troll ppl and have fun :3  
Especially useful in 2v2 when both player can use different spell to bring tower health down  
~~recommanded to be used with rage baiting emotes and rocket tower at 4 sec left~~

config:
-
when first started this program, a config json file will be created. Enter -1 to tower damage to edit the config.  
the lower the maximum health is, the more iteration u need to give, to make sure it doesnt exit too early.  
spells should be ordered in decending damage.  
set the spell to disable if u dont have the spell
